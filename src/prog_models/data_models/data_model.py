    Abstract Base Class for all Data Models (e.g., LSTM, DMD). Defines the interface and all common tools. To create a new Data-Driven model, first subclass this, then define the abstract methods from this class and PrognosticsModel

        Create a Data Model from data. This class is overwritten by specific data-driven classes (e.g., LSTM)

        Args:
            data (List[Tuple[Array, Array]]): list of runs to use for training. Each element is a tuple (input, output) for a single run. Input and Output are of size (n_times, n_inputs/outputs)

            See specific data class for more information

        Returns:
            DataModel: Trained PrognosticsModel
