The Prognostics Model Package is a python package for the modeling and simulation of the evolution of state for components, systems, and systems of systems, with a focus on simulating specific events. When used for prognostics, these events are typically system failures, such as a winding failure on a motor or full discharge of a battery. \n",

    "* __Event__: Something that can be predicted (e.g., system failure, warning threshold). An event has either occurred or not. \n",
    "* __Event State__: Progress towards event occurring. Defined as a number where an event state of 0 indicates the event has occurred and 1 indicates no progress towards the event (i.e., fully healthy operation for a failure event). For gradually occurring events (e.g., discharge) the number will progress from 1 to 0 as the event nears. In prognostics, event state is frequently called \"State of Health\" or \"SOH\"\n",
    "* __Inputs__: Control applied to the system being modeled (e.g., current drawn from a battery)\n",
    "* __Outputs__: Measured sensor values from a system (e.g., voltage and temperature of a battery), outputs can be estimated from system state\n",
    "* __States__: Internal parameters (typically hidden states) used to represent the state of the system- can be the same as inputs/outputs but do not have to be. \n",

    "The `prog_models` package has the following structure\n",
    "* `prog_models.data_models` - package containing algorithms for data-driven models, and parent class `prog_models.data_models.DataModel`\n",
    "* `prog_models.datasets` - package containing tools for downloading a few relevant datasets\n",
    "* `prog_models.models.*` - implemented models (e.g., pump, valve, battery)\n",
    "* `prog_models.LinearModel` - Parent class for simple linear models\n",
    "* `prog_models.PrognosticsModel` - parent class for all prognostics models - defines interfaces that a model must implement, and tools for simulating said model \n",
