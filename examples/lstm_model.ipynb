    "In this example, we generate fake data using the ThrownObject model. This is a case where we're generating a surrogate model from the physics-based model. For cases where you're generating a model from data (e.g., collected from a testbed or a real-world environment), you'll replace that generated data with your own. We then use the generated model and compare to the original model.\n",

The LSTM model in this method maps from [u_t-n+1, z_t-n, ..., u_t, z_t-1] to z_t. Past `input` are stored in the `model` internal `state`. Actual calculation of `output` is performed when `LSTMStateTransitionModel.output` is called. When using in simulation that may not be until the simulation results are accessed."
