    """
    A Prognostics Model where the first derivative of state can be defined for any time

    The DerivProgModel class is a wrapper around a mathematical model of a
    system as represented by a dx, output, input, and threshold equations.
    It is a subclass of the Model class, with the addition of a threshold
    equation, which defines when some condition, such as end-of-life, has
    been reached.
