estimate_params from this link needs to be updated: https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_models/PrognosticModel.html#prog_models.PrognosticsModel.estimate_params
, updated in the function definition, however not on the website.

 - Created test to see what happens if bounds go the wrong way. i.e (30, 7) instead of (7, 30)

Think of ways to create more descriptive error messages

Begin checking other parameters for params_estimate

Statement ____ Swap ordering in params_estimate for bounds and method. ^^website

Question*** Shouldn't changing optimization method chagne end values?

Are default options set to make it various questions more optimal

Idea: on line 1238 of pringistcs_model, I provide change the logic to provide a more acurate error message and detail what exactly is not equal to one another.
            and potneitally have their values shown.

Question*** Is runs 'depreciated' since one of the parameters is marked as 'depreciated'

        # with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
        # Does not do anything. Probably want to include an error message or some indicator to let the user know
        # in case user is expected change however is not seeing it.

Line 148 does not work as intended?

Talk about runs parameter.
